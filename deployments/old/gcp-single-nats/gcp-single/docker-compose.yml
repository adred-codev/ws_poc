# Production overrides for deployments/local/docker-compose.yml
# Usage: docker compose -f ../local/docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.yml up -d
#
# ============================================================================
# E2-SMALL RESOURCE CONFIGURATION (GCP)
# ============================================================================
# Total Available: 2 vCPU (shared), 2GB RAM
# Cost: $12.23/month (vs e2-micro $6.12/month or FREE with free tier)
#
# Current Allocation (inherited from docker-compose.yml):
#   ws-go:      1.5 CPU (75%)    768M (38%)  - WebSocket server (priority)
#   nats:       0.25 CPU (12%)   128M (6%)   - Message broker
#   prometheus: 0.15 CPU (7.5%)  128M (6%)   - Metrics (7d retention)
#   grafana:    0.1 CPU (5%)     256M (12%)  - Dashboards
#   loki:       0.1 CPU (5%)     128M (6%)   - Logs
#   publisher:  0.1 CPU (5%)     64M (3%)    - Test publisher
#   promtail:   0.1 CPU (5%)     64M (3%)    - Log collector
#   -----------
#   TOTAL:      2.3 CPU (115%)   1536M (75%) ✅ FITS WITH HEADROOM
#
# Notes:
#   - Total CPU 15% over limit but acceptable (burstable e2-small)
#   - Memory at 75% with 25% headroom (512MB free)
#   - ws-go has priority and will get resources first
#   - Monitoring services now have sufficient memory (no OOM kills)
#   - Prometheus retention: 7d (can increase to 15-30d if needed)
#   - Upgraded from e2-micro due to Grafana/Loki/Promtail OOM kills
#
# Previous Issues (RESOLVED):
#   - e2-micro: Grafana/Loki/Promtail OOM killed (32-64MB limits too low)
#   - e2-small: Grafana memory starvation at 98.77% (128M → 256M)
#
# ============================================================================
# PRODUCTION OVERRIDES
# ============================================================================
# This file only overrides:
#   - Restart policies (restart: always)
#   - Log rotation (10M max size, 3 files)
#   - External port exposure
#   - Grafana admin password from environment
#
# Resource limits are inherited from docker-compose.yml and NOT changed here
# to maintain consistency between dev and production environments.
