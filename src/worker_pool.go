// Task represents a work item for the worker pool.
// Tasks are functions with no parameters or return values.
// They are executed asynchronously by worker goroutines.
type Task func()

// WorkerPool manages a fixed pool of worker goroutines for concurrent task execution.
//
// Purpose:
//   - Limit concurrent goroutines to prevent resource exhaustion
//   - Process NATS messages and broadcast to clients without blocking
//   - Provides backpressure when system is overloaded
//
// Design:
//   - Fixed number of workers (typically 2 × CPU cores)
//   - Buffered task queue (workerCount × 100 capacity)
//   - If queue full, tasks execute synchronously in caller goroutine
//
// Performance characteristics:
//   - With 8 CPU cores: 16 workers, 1600 task queue capacity
//   - Each broadcast takes ~1-2ms with 10,000 clients
//   - Can handle ~500-1000 broadcasts/second sustained
//
// Memory usage:
//   - Worker goroutines: 16 × 2KB stack = 32KB
//   - Task queue: 1600 × 8 bytes (function pointer) = 12.8KB
//   - Total: ~45KB (negligible)
//
// Thread safety:
//
//	All methods are safe for concurrent use by multiple goroutines.

// NewWorkerPool creates a worker pool with the specified number of workers.
//
// Parameters:
//
//	workerCount - Number of worker goroutines (typically 2 × CPU cores)
//
// Queue sizing:
//   - Buffer capacity: workerCount × 100
//   - Example: 16 workers → 1600 task buffer
//   - Reasoning: Handles burst of NATS messages during traffic spikes
//
// Recommended workerCount values:
//   - Development: runtime.NumCPU()
//   - Production: runtime.GOMAXPROCS(0) × 2
//   - Container: Automatically set via automaxprocs

// Must be called before Submit. Safe to call only once.

//   - When context is cancelled, workers finish current task and exit
//   - New tasks submitted after cancellation are dropped
//
// Workers remain active until Stop is called or context is cancelled.

// worker is the main loop for each worker goroutine.
// Continuously pulls tasks from the queue and executes them.
//
// Behavior:
//   - Blocks waiting for task or context cancellation
//   - Executes tasks synchronously (one at a time per worker)
//   - Gracefully exits when context is cancelled
//   - No panic recovery - tasks must handle their own errors
//
// Note: If a task panics, the worker goroutine will crash.
// Production enhancement: Add panic recovery and logging.

// Submit enqueues a task for asynchronous execution by a worker.
//
// Behavior:
//   - If queue has space: Task is queued and Submit returns immediately
//   - If queue is full: Task is DROPPED and counter incremented
//
// Task dropping provides backpressure:
//   - Prevents goroutine explosion when system overloaded
//   - Prevents unbounded memory growth
//   - Drops work instead of crashing under load
//   - Dropped count tracked in droppedTasks (atomic counter)
//
// CRITICAL: This prevents the goroutine explosion that causes CPU → 100%
// When publisher rate × client count exceeds worker capacity, tasks are dropped
// instead of spawning unlimited goroutines.
//
// Thread safety: Safe for concurrent use by multiple goroutines.
//
// Example:
//
//	pool.Submit(func() {
//	    server.broadcast(message)
//	})

	case wp.taskQueue <- task:

// Stop gracefully shuts down the worker pool.
//
// Shutdown sequence:
//  1. Closes task queue (no new tasks accepted)
//  2. Workers finish currently executing tasks
//  3. Workers process any remaining queued tasks
//  4. All workers exit
//  5. Stop returns when all workers have finished
//
// Blocks until all workers have completed.
// Safe to call multiple times (subsequent calls are no-op).
//
// Note: Tasks submitted after Stop is called will panic (send on closed channel).
func (wp *WorkerPool) Stop() {
	close(wp.taskQueue)
	wp.wg.Wait()
}

// GetDroppedTasks returns the total number of tasks dropped due to queue full.
// This counter indicates backpressure - when broadcast rate exceeds worker capacity.
//
// High dropped task count means:
//   - Publisher rate too high for current client count
//   - Worker pool too small for the workload
//   - CPU can't keep up with message fanout
//
// Thread safety: Safe for concurrent use (atomic read).
