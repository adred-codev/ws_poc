## Contributing to Documentation

When adding new documentation:

1. **Architecture docs** â†’ `/architecture/` - System design, data flows, technical deep-dives
2. **Monitoring docs** â†’ `/monitoring/` - Prometheus, Grafana, alerts, dashboards
3. **Development docs** â†’ `/development/` - Local setup, workflows, debugging, tools

### Documentation Standards

- Use Markdown format
- Include code examples where applicable
- Add diagrams for complex flows (use Mermaid or ASCII)
- Keep language clear and concise
- Update this README when adding new docs
- Reference Taskfile commands where applicable (e.g., `task gcp:deploy:initial`)
